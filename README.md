SettingsSentry is a lightweight macOS tool that __backs up and restores your application settings__, so you donâ€™t lose them during system resets, migrations, or disk issues.

Whether you want to __sync settings across machines__, __version your preferences__, or simply __avoid starting from scratch__, SettingsSentry makes it easy. Unlike Mackup, it fully supports macOS Sonoma+ and doesnâ€™t risk breaking your preferences.

ðŸ›  No GUI needed â€” install it once, automate it with cron, and let it handle the rest.

Inspired by [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup), SettingsSentry was created to address compatibility issues with macOS Sonoma and later versions. Unlike Mackup, which no longer supports symlinked preference files and risks destroying user preferences, SettingsSentry provides a reliable solution.

## Why use SettingsSentry instead of Mackup?

- âœ… Full compatibility with macOS Sonoma and future versions
- âœ… No risk of overwriting your settings via symlinks
- âœ… Dry-run support to preview operations
- âœ… Cron integration for automated syncing
- âœ… Backup and restore of macOS preferences
- âœ… Support for environment variables in configuration paths and values
- âœ… Configuration validation to ensure all required fields are present
- âœ… Versioned backups with timestamp-based directories
- âœ… Dry-run mode to preview operations without making changes
- âœ… Optional ZIP archive backup format (`-zip` flag)


## Features

- Backup configuration files to iCloud Drive or a specified folder.
- Restore configurations seamlessly to their original locations.
- Install a CRON job that runs at every system reboot.
- Remove the installed CRON job when no longer needed.
- Support for environment variables in configuration paths and values.
- Configuration validation to ensure all required fields are present.
- Versioned backups with timestamp-based directories.
- Dry-run mode to preview operations without making changes.
- Optional ZIP archive backup format (`-zip` flag).
- Optional password-based encryption (`-password` flag).

## Usage

./SettingsSentry `<action>` `<optional parameters>` [-config=`<path>`] [-backup=`<path>`] [-app=`<app1,app2,...>`] [-commands] [-dry-run] [-versions=`<n>`] [-logfile=`<path>`] [-password=<pwd>] [-zip]

### Actions

- `backup`: Backup configuration files to the specified backup folder.
- `restore`: Restore the files to their original locations.
- `install`: Install the application as a CRON job that runs at every reboot.
    You can also provide a valid cron expression as a parameter to customize the schedule (0 9 \* \* \*). Use [cronhub](https://crontab.cronhub.io) to generate a valid one.
- `remove`: Remove the previously installed CRON job.
- `configsinit`: Extract embedded default configurations to a 'configs' directory located next to the executable. This allows for customization of the configurations and provides a way to view the default settings.

### Default Values

Configurations: configs
Backups: iCloud Drive/settingssentry_backups

#### Options

- `-config` `<path>`: Path to the configuration folder (default: `configs`).

- `-backup` `<path>`: Path to the backup folder (default: `iCloud Drive/settingssentry_backups`).

- `-app` `<app1,app2,...>`: Optional: Comma-separated list of application names to process.

- `-commands`: Executes pre and post commands during backup or restore where available.

- `-dry-run`: Perform a dry run without making any changes.

- `-versions` `<n>`: Number of backup versions to keep (default: 1, 0 = keep all).

- `-zip`: Create backup as a timestamped `.zip` archive instead of a directory (backup action only).

- `-logfile` `<path>`: Path to log file. If provided, logs will be written to this file in addition to console output.

- `-password` `<pwd>`: Optional password to encrypt backups (using AES-GCM). If provided during backup, files will be encrypted and saved with a `.encrypted` extension. This password **must** be provided again during restore to decrypt the files.

### Environment Variables

SettingsSentry supports the following environment variables:

- `SETTINGSSENTRY_CONFIG`: Path to the configuration folder.
- `SETTINGSSENTRY_BACKUP`: Path to the backup folder.
- `SETTINGSSENTRY_APP`: Optional: Comma-separated list of application names to process.
- `SETTINGSSENTRY_COMMANDS`: Set to 'true' to perform command execution during backup or restore.
- `SETTINGSSENTRY_DRY_RUN`: Set to 'true' to perform a dry run without making any changes.
- `SETTINGSSENTRY_PASSWORD`: Password for encryption/decryption (alternative to `-password` flag).

### Configuration Files

All configuration files are stored in the `configs` folder. Below is an example of a configuration file named `{name}.cfg`:

```ini

[application]
# Name of the application to backup
name = Brew

[backup_commands] # This directive is optional
# Command to execute for backing up installed packages
brew bundle dump --force --file=~/.Brewfile

[restore_commands]
# Command to execute for restoring packages from the backup
brew bundle install --file=~/.Brewfile

[configuration_files]
# List of configuration files to copy (supports files and folders)
.Brewfile

```

This configuration file specifies the application name, backup and restore commands, as well as the necessary configuration files.

#### Environment Variables in Configuration Files

You can use environment variables in your configuration files using the `${VAR_NAME}` syntax:

```ini
[application]
name = ${APP_NAME}

[configuration_files]
${CONFIG_DIR}/.config
~/Library/${APP_NAME}/settings.json
```

Environment variables will be expanded when the configuration is loaded, making it easy to reuse the same configuration across different environments or users.

### Versioned Backups

SettingsSentry creates versioned backups using timestamp-based directories (format: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS). This allows you to:

1. Keep multiple versions of your configuration backups
2. Restore from the latest version automatically
3. Limit the number of versions to keep using the `--versions` command-line argument

When restoring, SettingsSentry automatically uses the most recent backup version available.

### Dry Run Mode

The dry-run mode allows you to preview what would happen during backup or restore operations without making any actual changes to your system. This is useful for:

1. Testing new configurations
2. Verifying what files would be backed up or restored
3. Checking which commands would be executed

To use dry-run mode, add the `-dry-run` flag to your command:


### Encryption

SettingsSentry supports optional password-based encryption for your backups using AES-256-GCM.

- To **encrypt** a backup, provide a password using the `-password "your-secret-password"` flag or the `SETTINGSSENTRY_PASSWORD` environment variable during the `backup` action.
- Encrypted files will be stored with a `.encrypted` extension appended to their original name within the timestamped backup directory or zip file.
- To **restore** an encrypted backup, you **must** provide the **same password** using the `-password` flag or the `SETTINGSSENTRY_PASSWORD` environment variable during the `restore` action.
- If an encrypted backup (`.encrypted` files) is detected during restore and no password is provided, the restore for those files will fail with an error message prompting for the password.
- **Security Note:** The security of the encryption relies heavily on the strength of the password you choose. Use a strong, unique password.

```sh
./SettingsSentry backup -dry-run
```
